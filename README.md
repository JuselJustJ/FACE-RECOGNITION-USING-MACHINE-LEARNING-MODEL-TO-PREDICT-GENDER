# Face-Recognition-Using-Machine-Learning-Model-to-Predict-Gender.
Face recognition has been done with the help of python programming language and that has predicted gender by various classification models. Naive Bayes, random forest classifiers and Logistic regression are the classifiers techniques which are used to apply the classification of image data and then gender has been predicted based on these classification techniques of image. With this data, machine learning algorithms have been applied to the image of the image data with CSV files and then the gender has been identified. Image classification is the process of assigning a label or category to an image. It is commonly used in machine learning and is used to classify objects, scenes, and activities in images.
